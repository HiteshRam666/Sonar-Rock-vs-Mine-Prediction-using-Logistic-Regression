# Sonar Rock ðŸ¥Œ vs Mine ðŸ’£ Prediction using Logistic Regression

Underwater Mine usage by the Naval Defense System provides great Security but also possesses a threat to
the marine life and submarine vessels as the mines can be easily mistaken for rocks. So, we need a much
more accurate system to predict the object as it is very dangerous if a mistake is made. To have a great
accuracy we need more accurate data to generate accurate results. Our idea presents a method for
prediction of underwater mines and rocks using Sonar Signals. Sonar Signals are used to record the various
frequencies of underwater objects at 60 different angles. We constructed three binary classifier models
according to their accuracy. Then, prediction models are used to predict the mine and rock categories.
Python and Supervised Machine Learning Classification algorithms are used to construct these prediction
models.

# Why we need Sonar Rock Vs Mine Prediction ? 

Underwater mines or naval mines are self-contained explosive devices placed in water to destroy enemiesâ€™
surface ships or submarines. Underwater mines are used since the mid-19th Century. Sea mines were
introduced by David Bushner in 1977 during the American civil war. Previously mines were only activated by
physical contact but the newly created mines can be activated by various methods. Modern mines can be
activated by acoustic, pressure, and magnetic changes in the water which provoke them to explode. These
are called influence mines. Generally, Underwater mines are classified as offensive or defensive warfare.
Mines are strewn across hostile shipping lanes in order to damage merchant ships and military boats.
Defensive mines are placed along coastlines to divert enemy submarines and ships away from critical
locations and into more heavily guarded places. Usually, Mines are mistaken as rocks during their
identification, as mines can have the same shape, length, and width as rocks.
